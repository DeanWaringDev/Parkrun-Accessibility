# ðŸŽ¯ **Implementation Strategy Based on Your Answers**

## **1. Google Elevation API Cost Analysis:**
- **Current pricing**: ~$5 per 1,000 requests
- **Route analysis**: Assuming 20-50 elevation points per 5km route
- **Estimated cost**: $275-$685 for initial analysis of all 2,747 routes
- **One-time cost** is very reasonable for the data quality we'll get

## **2. AI Service Research Suggestions:**

**For Course Descriptions & Keywords:**
- **OpenAI GPT-4** - Most reliable, ~$0.03 per 1K tokens (probably $50-100 total)
- **Anthropic Claude** - Good alternative, similar pricing
- **Local Models** - Llama 3.1 (free but requires setup/hardware)

**Recommended approach**: Start with OpenAI for proof of concept, can switch to local models later for cost savings.

## **3. Web Scraping Architecture:**

**Data Flow:**
```
Parkrun Course Page â†’ Raw HTML â†’ Text Extraction â†’ AI Processing
                                      â†“
Store Raw Text â†’ Generate Keywords â†’ Generate Summary â†’ Database
```

**What we'll scrape:**
- Course description text
- Any accessibility mentions
- Terrain information
- Facilities information
- Parking/transport info

## **4. Data Validation & Missing Data Strategy:**

**Validation Tiers:**
- **Tier 1 (Essential)**: Name, Location, Coordinates â†’ Must have for inclusion
- **Tier 2 (Important)**: Course description, Google Maps link â†’ Flag for manual review if missing
- **Tier 3 (Enhanced)**: Elevation data, AI analysis â†’ Mark as "Analysis Pending" if unavailable

**User Feedback Integration:**
- Simple rating system (1-5 stars per mobility type)
- Comment system for specific accessibility notes
- Moderation system for user contributions

## **5. Quarterly Update Pipeline:**

**Automated Update Process:**
1. **Data Refresh**: Re-scrape course pages for changes
2. **User Feedback Integration**: Incorporate validated user ratings
3. **AI Re-analysis**: Update descriptions/keywords with new data
4. **Elevation Refresh**: Re-check any previously failed elevation calls
5. **Quality Assurance**: Validate changes before publishing

## ðŸ“‹ **Proposed Development Phases:**

### **Phase 1: Data Foundation (Week 1-2)**
- Set up database schema
- Build parkrun course page scraper
- Extract and store raw course descriptions
- Implement basic data validation

### **Phase 2: AI Integration (Week 3)**
- Set up AI service integration (OpenAI to start)
- Develop keyword extraction system
- Build course description summarization
- Create AI prompt templates

### **Phase 3: Elevation Analysis (Week 4)**
- Integrate Google Elevation API
- Build route elevation profiling
- Calculate gradient analysis
- Generate accessibility ratings

### **Phase 4: User System (Week 5)**
- Build user feedback API endpoints
- Create rating/comment system
- Implement moderation tools
- User contribution validation

### **Phase 5: Update Pipeline (Week 6)**
- Build automated update scripts
- Create quarterly refresh process
- Implement change detection
- Quality assurance workflows

## ðŸ”§ **Technical Architecture Questions:**

**Database Design:**
- Should we store raw scraped HTML for future re-processing?
- How granular should user feedback be? (overall rating vs. detailed categories)

**AI Processing:**
- Batch process all descriptions at once or real-time as needed?
- Should we store AI prompts/responses for debugging/improvement?

**API Design:**
- RESTful endpoints for frontend integration
- Search/filter capabilities (location, accessibility scores, keywords)
- Pagination for large result sets

**Scraping Strategy:**
- Start with UK sites first (1,318 events) then expand?
- Rate limiting to be respectful to parkrun servers?
- Error handling for failed scrapes?

**Does this roadmap align with your vision? Which phase would you like to dive into first - the foundational data processing or shall we start building the scraper to see what course page data we can extract?**
